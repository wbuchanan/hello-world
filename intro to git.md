__1. You can open a git command line interface by right clicking in a folder. ![Git Bash](https://github.com/nathant23/hello-world/blob/master/img/01_start_Git_Bash.png)__

__2. Git begins tracking a folder (repository) when you type the command `git init`. Only folders in which you have initialized git are tracked. ![git init](https://github.com/nathant23/hello-world/blob/master/img/02_git_init.png)__
